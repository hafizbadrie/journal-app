My training ground with Golang.

# Activities
What I went through:

1. Create the code base under `$GOPATH`
2. Need to ensure I have `dep` tool
3. Init go mod, by running `go mod init`
4. Then, run `go mod vendor` to enable vendoring in golang
5. Run `dep init` and `dep ensure`, but I need to remove my ssh passphrase first
6. Build the code `go build main.go`
7. Run it `./main`
